                      <p>
                        I am a Software Engineer who just finished his Masterâ€™s
                        in Software Engineering at Villanova University.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I am a dedicated and enthusiastic professional who loves
                        programming. I have 2+ years of experience as a Software
                        Engineer/ Web Developer.I have always loved making
                        software. Making software is hard and doing it in the
                        right way, is even harder. So, I try to follow the best
                        Software practices to do my tasks in the real world. I
                        beleive that we are always learning, so I try to learn
                        everyday from my colleagues as well as from anyone I can
                        and vice-versa. I believe that sharing knowledge with
                        each other is best way to teach each other and is the
                        best form of the human kind. So, being positive is the
                        best way to move forward.{" "}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Besides, getting my hands on making software, I like to
                        use my free time by playing Soccer, dancing and doing
                        gym. To improve on dancing, I even joined a dancing
                        club. I believe one should be happy in whatever he is
                        doing and dancing makes me really happy.

                      I have experience of building a full-stack website using
                      JavaScript(FrontEnd- React.js) and BackEnd(Node.js) I have
                      also experience in deploying the website using Heroku and
                      AWS. I am also knowledgeable in other front-end technology
                      like (Aurelia Js).

                      I have a good grasp of the fundamentals of DSA.It is
                      really important to optimize our code and to do so, we
                      should have a very good knowledge of DSA. I found it to be
                      the one of the most important skill for a programmer.

                      I also have knowledge of how the software should be

                      deployment phase.I have worked in an Agile Environment
                      which has taught me a lot about how the software should be
                      made.
